# MachineLearning and Data Mining

Projects and from UCR's Machine Learning and Data Mining Class that I completed in Matlab.
## Projects
* **PS1 (Ridge Regression)**: 
    * Ridge Regression with Least squares
* **PS2 (Logistic Regression & KNN)**:
	* Logistic Regression using both Linear and Quadratic models
  	* Cross Validation K-Nearest neighbor
* **PS3 (Neural Network)**: 
   	* 2 Layer Neural Network (2 layers of wights, 1 hidden layer of units) 
   	* All non-linearities are sigmoids 
   	* A plot function was implemented to display the results
* **PS4 (Decision Tree)**:
	* Decision Tree Classifier
	* Association Analysis is preformed on Data set.
	* The findrules function returns list of rules that meet restrictions, sorted by confidence.
	* Apriori Algorithm was implemented
